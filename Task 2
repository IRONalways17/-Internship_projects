To build a classification model for the Iris dataset, we'll follow these steps in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

Pseudocode:
Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries.
Load Dataset: Use scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset.
Split Dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).
Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Predict on the test set and evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Result: Print the evaluation metrics.
