To develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms, follow these steps in Python using libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for preprocessing and model training, and matplotlib for visualization (if needed).
Pseudocode:
1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries.
2. Load Dataset: Load the housing dataset using pandas.
3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values by imputation or dropping.
   - Extract features (X) and target variable (y).
4. Feature Scaling: Scale numerical features to normalize their range.
5. Split Dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Model Training
   - Train a model using Linear Regression or Decision Trees.
7. Model Evaluation:
   - Predict house prices on the test set.
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
8. Result: Print the evaluation metric to assess performance.
